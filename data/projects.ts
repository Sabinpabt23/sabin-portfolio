    longDescription:
      "Nebula is a virtual stock trading and market-education platform built on NestJS and React, combining a custom real-time market simulation engine, broker-mediated collateral management, and full administrative oversight under a strict layered architecture. The platform is split into three independently deployable processes with non-overlapping responsibilities: a React SPA client, a NestJS server that is the sole authority on business rules and financial state, and a standalone market simulation engine that never talks to the client directly. Every trading action, price update, and notification passes through the server. Authentication supports email/password and Google OAuth 2.0 registration, with short-lived 15-minute JWT access tokens held in memory only, 7-day refresh tokens delivered as HTTP-only cookies and rotated on every use, and refresh-token reuse detection that invalidates every active session on an account the moment a stolen token is replayed. Each device holds an independent, individually revocable refresh token, and access tokens are blacklisted on logout before any database lookup occurs. The Trader Portal covers Market and Limit order placement with idempotency-key support against duplicate submissions, a live order book depth ladder, order history with cancellation and automatic release of reserved funds, a portfolio view with cost basis and unrealized P&L, a watchlist with self-clearing one-time price alerts, a paginated wallet transaction ledger, and broker-routed collateral top-up requests. The Broker Dashboard gives brokers a list of assigned traders with balances and activity summaries, per-trader detail views, collateral top-up processing under a weekly cap enforced through database aggregation rather than a cache counter, mandatory receipt upload with duplicate-reference prevention, and suspicious-activity flagging with resolution tracking. The Admin Panel adds platform-wide statistics with a composite market index chart, user suspension that automatically cancels pending orders and releases reserved balances, broker application review and reassignment, top-up oversight with cap-override authority, suspicious-flag resolution, learning-content management, and a full audit log. At the core of the platform is a market simulation engine using Geometric Brownian Motion with sector-specific volatility and drift, a Box-Muller transform for normally distributed price movement, a circuit breaker that halts a stock once it moves beyond 10% of the previous close, and a Redis-backed order book with price-time priority and self-trade prevention. The engine is completely independent of the rest of the platform, with no Prisma, no NestJS, no PostgreSQL, and no knowledge of users or wallets. It communicates with the server only through Redis pub/sub and a polled HTTP health endpoint that gates order placement when the engine is unreachable. The server enforces a strict four-layer separation in every module: controllers handle routing only, services own all business logic, repositories own all Prisma and Redis access, and DTOs handle request validation, with a single global exception filter as the only place in the codebase that constructs an error response. All monetary values are stored as integer paise, never floating point, and any wallet read-then-write acquires a Redis distributed lock ahead of a Prisma transaction, backstopped by a PostgreSQL CHECK constraint against negative balances. Real-time updates reach the client through room-scoped Socket.IO events: stock-specific rooms for price updates, user-specific rooms for fills and portfolio changes, and platform-wide broadcasts for circuit-breaker and market-status events.",

    longDescription:
      "SkillSwap is a full-stack marketplace where people trade skills instead of money, built on a Laravel 13 API with a Next.js 16 client and real-time messaging over Laravel Reverb WebSockets. The platform covers the complete lifecycle of a skill exchange: browsing and searching teachers by skill, sending a skill request with a proposed time, and moving that request through a six-state state machine, with seven server-side guards enforcing valid transitions and a scheduled job auto-expiring stale requests. Once a request is accepted, participants get real-time one-to-one chat with image and file attachments via Cloudinary, cursor-paginated history with infinite scroll, read/unread tracking, and message deduplication across the HTTP POST and WebSocket echo paths. Completed exchanges feed into a review and reputation system: one review per participant per request, cached average ratings in Redis, and admin moderation for hidden reviews, with an audit log on every state change. A real-time notification system covers every major event with a bell, an unread badge, per-type navigation targets, mark-all-read (deliberately excluding message_received), soft-delete dismiss, and server-side deduplication across three listeners. The admin portal adds a dashboard with six real-time metric cards, user suspension, and review moderation, all behind Sanctum authentication and role middleware. The codebase enforces a strict three-layer architecture end-to-end: controllers route only, services own all business logic, and repositories handle all Eloquent queries, with no layer bleeding, backed by 105 automated tests and 241 assertions running CI-green via GitHub Actions. Visually, the platform uses a custom design system: a copper, verdigris, sage, and ink palette, Fraunces display serif paired with Inter body text and JetBrains Mono for numeric records, semantic Tailwind CSS v4 tokens, and a responsive mobile-first layout with a hamburger sidebar. The whole stack runs locally via Docker Compose across eight services (PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7, Mailhog, the Laravel server, the Reverb WebSocket server, the Next.js client, a queue worker, and a scheduler) with no local dependencies required.",

    longDescription:
      "MediLife is a full-featured hospital management platform built on Java Jakarta EE, covering patient registration, doctor approval workflows, appointment scheduling, billing, medical records, and administrative control across three distinct roles. Access is split between Admin, Doctor, and Patient accounts, secured with BCrypt password hashing, session-based authentication, and an admin approval workflow that gates new doctor registrations before they can accept patients. Booking supports two flows: a Request Appointment path where an admin assigns the best-fit doctor, and a Quick Consult path for direct booking, with admin reassignment and doctor-side rejection handling built into both. The Admin Panel centralizes platform oversight: real-time statistics, doctor approvals with license review, appointment management, user lock/unlock, department management, financial reports with CSV export, system logs, and broadcast announcements. The Doctor Portal gives physicians a dashboard of today's appointments and earnings (both total and monthly), the ability to confirm or complete appointments, add diagnoses and prescriptions, review a patient's medical history, and reject appointments with a reason. The Patient Portal covers registration with medical details and profile image upload, booking through either flow, viewing upcoming and past appointments, cancelling pending ones, and accessing full medical history. A real-time notification bell with unread counts fires on booking, confirmation, completion, billing, account actions, assignment, and rejection events, backed by a full history page. Doctors also get individual public portfolio pages (education timeline, experience, expertise, certifications, and publications) with a book-appointment call to action gated behind a login check. The system is built on a strict MVC architecture end-to-end: JSP views handle display only, Servlets handle routing only, Services own all business logic and validation, a DAO layer owns all database queries, Filters enforce authentication and role-based access control, and Utils hold shared helpers, keeping every layer's responsibility non-overlapping.",

Member lifecycle management covers adding Regular or Premium members, tracking attendance with loyalty points awarded per visit (+5 for a regular visit, +10 for a milestone visit), and upgrading Regular members through a Basic, Standard, Deluxe progression once they have logged 30 visits and paid in full. The payment system records partial or full payments, automatically applies a 10% discount for Premium members paying in full, and stores all currency as long paisa values to avoid floating-point rounding bugs. Removed members are not hard-deleted; a soft-delete-with-restoration model keeps their historical attendance, loyalty, and payment data intact and restorable, and CSV save/load preserves the complete member state across sessions. The UI uses the Nimbus look-and-feel, a menu bar with an Actions dropdown, a filterable member table (Active, Removed, All), and an About dialog with a built-in usage guide.",

The pipeline starts with a full data wrangling pass: removing NaN values, detecting and handling duplicates (28.56% of the raw dataset), and narrowing the feature set down to 16 key columns most relevant to classification. Exploratory analysis includes a Pearson correlation heatmap that surfaced a 0.9951 correlation between Packet Length Mean and Average Packet Size, flagging a redundant feature before any modelling began and preventing wasted model capacity downstream. A Welch's t-test on Flow Duration returned a p-value of 0.4736, showing that no single feature could reliably separate the two traffic classes on its own and motivating a multi-feature machine learning approach rather than a naive threshold rule. The project treats statistical rigor as a prerequisite to modelling: every feature-selection and preprocessing decision is backed by an explicit test rather than intuition.",
